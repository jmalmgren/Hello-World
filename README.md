# Hello-World
Repository for Git tutorial

Hi - my nick name is Jaska, and I am an entrepreneur from Finland.
Started my programming career pretty much exactly 40 years ago, in September 1975.
Well, I spent some 20 years in sales, but never lost my interest in coding.
GitHub seems like a place to be in, so here I am :-)
